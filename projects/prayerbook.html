                    into the palm of your hand. With high-quality audio prayers, interactive rosary meditations,
                    and the Pope's monthly intentions, it offers a rich, contemplative experience — whether you're

                </p>
                <p>
                    The app supports CarPlay for hands-free prayer during drives, Apple Watch for quick access
                    on the go, an immersive visionOS experience for spatial prayer, and home screen widgets to
                    keep your spiritual practice front and center.

            <!-- Privacy Policy -->
            <section class="project-section" id="privacy">
                <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
                <p class="legal-updated">Last updated: February 2026</p>

                <h3>Data Collection</h3>
                <p>
                    Prayerbook collects only the data needed to personalize your experience — your prayer
                    history and preferences. All data is stored locally on your device.
                </p>

                <h3>Analytics & Crash Reporting</h3>
                <p>
                    The app uses Firebase Crashlytics and Analytics for crash reporting and anonymous usage
                    statistics. These services collect non-personal technical data (device model, OS version,
                    crash logs) to help improve stability. No personally identifiable information is collected.
                </p>

                <h3>Third-Party Services</h3>
                <p>
                    The app does not include advertising SDKs. Third-party services used are Firebase (crash
                    reporting and analytics) and SDWebImage (efficient image loading).
                </p>

                <h3>Data Retention & Deletion</h3>
                <p>
                    All prayer data is stored locally. Deleting the app removes all local data.
                </p>

                <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
                <p>
                    Prayerbook is suitable for all ages. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children.
                </p>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Which prayers are included?</summary>
                    <p>Prayerbook includes a comprehensive collection of Catholic prayers — from daily essentials
                        like the Our Father and Hail Mary to the Rosary, Chaplet of Divine Mercy, Litanies, and
                        seasonal prayers. New prayers are added regularly.</p>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Can I listen to prayers while driving?</summary>
                    <p>Yes! Prayerbook supports CarPlay, so you can listen to audio prayers during your commute.
                        The audio player also works in the background, so you can lock your phone and keep
                        listening.</p>
                </details>

                <details class="faq-item">
                    <summary>Does the app work offline?</summary>
                    <p>Absolutely. All prayers are cached locally so you can access them anytime, even without
                        an internet connection. Audio files are downloaded on first play and available offline
                        afterward.</p>
